* Codecs are guaranteed that:
*
* -- only one thread is entrant in a read/connect/inboundClose call at a time
*
* -- likewise, one thread is entrant in a write/outboundClose call at a time
*
* -- any unread data in the buffer passed to decode will be reclaimed by the outer
* context, and recycled, such that it will form the beginning of the next data segment
* passed to decode when more data arrives
*
* -- the order of any data emitted from encode/decode will be kept in the same
* order w.r.t. a happens-before relation of encode/decode calls. (within an encode, or a
* decode, scope. encode and decode are themselves disjoint.)
*
* Codecs must guarantee that:
*
* -- within the scope of a single decode call, all progress that can be made on the
* given data *is* made. ie, if a codec does not process all of the data passed to
* a decode call, then an arbitrary number of decode calls with that remaining data
* will always emit the empty buffer, and will always the passed in buffer marked
* as completely unread
*
* -- a call to encode with nonempty data *always* completely consumes the input,
* producing meaningful output.
