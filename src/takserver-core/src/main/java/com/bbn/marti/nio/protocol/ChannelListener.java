/**
* An interface for a listener receiving channel events.
*
* This interface is presented to the channel handler as its outgoing listener.
*
* A typed subinterface, Protocol, is used as a decorator for providing
* encoding/decoding facilities to transform a byte stream to its generic
* type. Data coming from the network is decoded to that type, and then
* passed to protocol listeners of the same or super type. Data coming
* from the application is of the given type, and is transformed to
* a byte stream.
*
* As far as reentrancy goes, a channel listener implementation is guaranteed that:
* -- only one thread is servicing an on_ call at a time.
*
* A channel listener implementation must guarantee that:
* -- all on_ calls are synchronous.
*
* The onInboundClose call signals that the channelListener will no longer receive
* network -{@literal >} application data
*
* The onOutboundClose call signals that the channel handler can no longer receive
* application -{@literal >} network traffic.
*
* A channel listener can expect that all onDataReceived calls, if any, come after
* an onConnect call, and that no further onDataReceived calls will be received
* after an onInboundClose call.
*
* There are no ordering constraints on onInbound/OutboundClose calls.
*
